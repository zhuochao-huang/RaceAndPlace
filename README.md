This repository provides the code for the simulation studies presented in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08059

The primary goal of this repository is to make all code associated with the simulation studies available to the research community. These scripts allow for the full reproduction of the simulation results discussed in the paper.

Due to licensing and privacy constraints associated with the proprietary cell phone mobility data which was purchased from a commercial provider the code and datasets for the empirical analyses cannot be made publicly available.
